Fall 2021 - Machine Learning

## Stuff you'll need
* Some kind of git client (if you don't already have one, I recommend [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/))
* [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual-d) because it has all of the Python packages you'll ever want for this class

## Git Etiquette
If you make changes that you want to push, please have it on your own `dev/<insert_name_here>` branch. Hopefully that will keep us from destroying each others work. 

Note:
If you do not know how to make your own branch, or push, or do git things in general please let me know. I will gladly offer bootleg git classes.

## Opening Jupyter Notebooks
For those of you who have never done this before:
* Open up your Anaconda command prompt / terminal:

* Navigate to wherever you cloned the repository and into the proper assignment folder
* Type `jupyter notebook` and hit enter:

* You should automatically get taken to a new webpage that looks something like this:

* Select the `.ipynb` file to open up the notebook
* If you have absolutely no idea what's going on you can mash the run button, or the run all button:
